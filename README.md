# GeoTracks

## What it does

Break down popular music data based off of regions using the TouchTones API. From there a user can see the popular artists and songs by area and view predicted trends for who may be popular later on in the area. These trends can also be used to plan concert tours by regions in which the artist was popular (note these features were not properly implemented)
## How we built it
We pull data from the TouchTunes API for one page and output it on a map using leaflet. Then the locations are highlighted based off of the music popularity in the area using JS and leaflet features.
## Challenges we ran into

How to properly use the API was the biggest challenge. We also struggled with deciding what we wanted to work on and figuring out our final product.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Implementing the map and popularity based off of the regions of choice.
## What we learned

We needed to get our plan decided quicker and plan better. Our downfall was not planning properly from the beginning.
## What's next for GeoTracks

We're going back to the drawing board and hope to implement Machine Learning for prediction trends
